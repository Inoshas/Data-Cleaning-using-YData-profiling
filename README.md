# Data Cleaning Exercise

This repository contains an exercise on data cleaning, where I used Python, YData Profiling, and OpenRefine to clean and analyze raw data. The project demonstrates common techniques used for data preprocessing and cleaning.

## Files Included

- **titanic.csv**: This is the raw data in CSV format that was used in the data cleaning process.
- **data_cleaning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used for data cleaning, including steps for exploration, cleaning, and analysis using YData profiling.
- **titanic_profile.html**: An HTML file generated by YData Profiling, which provides an in-depth analysis of the raw data, including statistics and visualizations.
- **Procedure to clean the data.pdf**: A PDF file providing a detailed, step-by-step description of the data cleaning process. It includes an explanation of the methods and tools used throughout the exercise.

## Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   To run the Jupyter Notebook and generate the YData profile, you will need the following libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install ydata-profiling pandas numpy

2.**Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
Open the data_cleaning.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells to see the step-by-step data cleaning process.

3.**View the Data Profile**:
Open the ydata_profile.html file in any browser to explore the data profiling results.

4.**Refer to the PDF**:
For a detailed explanation, you can review the Procedure to clean the data.pdf file, which outlines the entire data cleaning workflow and methodology.
